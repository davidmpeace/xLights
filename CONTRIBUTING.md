How to contribute to xLights

Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues. Are you really really sure it
is our bug ... maybe its you ... try asking on the official xLights Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/groups/628061113896314)
or the xLights forum (nutcracker123.com/forum) first ... and if that doesnt help then sure create an issue.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and
clear description, as much relevant information as possible. Include images, even a video and where appropriate either attach
a crash report, package the logs, or package the sequence (ensuring you dont include copyrighted content).

Fo enhancements similar rules apply. Be really sure this is a sensible and reasonable enhancement for the community. If it is just
something you would need then it is unlikely to be included. If it adds lots of complexity for users that wont be using your 
feature ... again ... unlikely to be included. Again include a descriptive title and a clear description. Be clear about the problem 
you are trying to solve first and foremost before sharing your designed solution. The idea may have merit even if your design
sucks. Again images and videos help. Terminology is important. If we cant understand the request then expect it to be rejected.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
Our code is not spectacularly consistent in structure or format ... do your best to be consistent with the code nearby your change.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

While we do fix these things please dont send us pull requests that only make cosmetic change.

Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change as an enhancement first and make your offer to develop it there and ask for comments. Typically one or more of
the developers will respond ... listen to their advice and warnings about where you will run into complexity.

We welcome new developers but the nature of the code base is such that there are areas you can easily introduce change ... and
there are areas of the code you should stay well away from until you are much much more familiar with it.

Do you have questions about the source code?

Ask questions in the facebook group or in the nutcracker forum.

Do you want to contribute to the manual?

Ask this one in the facebook group.
